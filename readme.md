### Learning React  
The majority of work I have been doing is considered backend programming. The Canvas Assignment Selector was initially designed as a basic web page. To truly make it a web application it needs to be built with a better user interface. A React UI will allow for better control of the information on the page.  

React is a popular web framework used by front-developers. It has a strong community of developers who make open source packages for it, updating it with new and great features.
